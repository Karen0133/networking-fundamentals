# Networking Fundamentals 🌐

## 1.1.3 The Internet
The internet is **not owned by any individual or group**. It is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetwork or “internet” for short), cooperating with each other to exchange information using **common standards**.

Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms.

Everything you access online is located somewhere on the global internet:
- Social media sites  
- Multiplayer games  
- Email and messaging services  
- Online courses  

All of these internet destinations are connected to **local networks** that send and receive information through the internet.

✨ **Examples of how networks bring the world together:**
- 📱 Intelligent networks allow handheld devices to receive news and emails, and to send texts.  
- 🎥 Video conferencing instantly connects people around the globe.  
- 🎮 Online gaming connects thousands of people seamlessly.  
- 📞 Phones connect globally to share voice, text, and images.

## 1.1.4 Local Networks
Local networks come in all sizes, from two connected computers to **hundreds of thousands of devices**.  

- **SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) Networks**:  
  Allow resource sharing (printers, documents, pictures, music) between a few local users.  

- **Business Networks**:  
  Used for advertising, selling products, ordering supplies, and communicating with customers.  
  - Faster and cheaper than traditional communication (mail, long distance calls).  
  - Enable rapid communication (email, instant messaging).  
  - Provide access to information stored on servers.  

✅ Both SOHO and business networks usually provide a **shared connection to the internet**.  
The internet is called a **“network of networks”** because it’s literally made up of thousands of local networks connected together.  

### Types of Local Networks:
- 🏠 **Small Home Networks**: Connect a few devices to each other and to the internet.  
- 🏢 **Small Office and Home Office Networks**: Designed for work-from-home or small teams.  
- 🏬 **Medium to Large Networks**: Connect many users, departments, and servers.
